## ðŸ“Š Predicting and Reducing Severe Chronic Absenteeism



Overview


This project identifies the most significant predictors of Severe Chronic Absenteeism (SCA) and proposes data-driven interventions to improve student attendance by at least 6%. Through statistical analysis and predictive modeling, we target at-risk students before they cross into severe absenteeism and recommend actionable strategies for early intervention.

Objectives
Identify key predictors of SCA using student data.

Build a predictive model to assess student risk.

Design targeted interventions to prevent absenteeism.

Improve overall school attendance rates.

Key Findings


ðŸ“Œ Significant Predictors of SCA:


Total Attendance Rate: Strong negative correlation (âˆ’0.77)

GPA (Cumulative & Current Weighted): Moderate negative correlation (âˆ’0.32)

Single-Parent Status: Weak positive correlation (+0.15)

Special Education Status: Weak positive correlation (~+0.11)

Students with lower attendance and academic performance are at the highest risk for SCA.


ðŸ“ˆ Model Performance
Logistic Regression was used to predict SCA.

High recall for students not in the SCA group (Class 0).

Lower recall for SCA group (Class 1), suggesting the need for future model refinement.

Target Group for Intervention
Students with:

Attendance rates between 81% and 90%

GPA below 2.5




Single-parent household status

These students show a higher potential for improvement and are the ideal candidates for preventative action.

Proposed Interventions
Academic Support
Tutoring and mentorship for students with low GPA to boost engagement and academic success.

Parental Engagement
Family counseling, teacher-parent conferences, and home visits for families with greater need for support.

Attendance Incentives
Tracking systems and positive reinforcement for moderate absenteeism (81â€“90%).

Socio-Economic Assistance
Free meals, transport support, and school supplies for disadvantaged students.

Estimated Impact
Focusing on the 81â€“90% attendance group could result in a 5â€“10% improvement in attendance for each student in that range, substantially boosting the schoolâ€™s overall attendance rate.

Conclusion
By combining predictive analytics with targeted, student-centered interventions, this project provides a strategic blueprint to combat chronic absenteeism. Implementing these interventions can help schools foster stronger student engagement and improve academic outcomes across the board.
